# Weather-App

Written by Charlie Earnshaw

This Application uses WeatherAPI.com (https://rapidapi.com/weatherapi/api/weatherapi-com) for api calls

In order for the API to work, create a file called credentials.py in the fastAPI backend and add rapid_api_key = "<YOUR RAPID API KEY>"

Run the backend using cd fastapi, uvicorn main:app --reload
Run the frontend using cd React/weather-app, npm install, npm start

I like to comment things for the purpose of making sure that I thoroughly understand my code
